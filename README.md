👋 Hi there! I'm beys, a passionate software developer with a love 
for building innovative solutions that make a difference.

💻 My journey in the world of coding started almost two years ago, 
and since then, I've been on an exciting quest to explore the realms of technology.

🚀 As a student, I try to explore as much of the software world as possible. 
Currently, my main interests are game, web, and app design.

🌱 Beyond coding, I'm deeply interested in art. From literature to film, theatre
to music, every single art form never fails to fascinate me.

💬 Let's connect and collaborate! Whether you're interested in discussing tech trends, 
brainstorming project ideas, or just sharing movie recommendations, feel free to reach out.
Together, let's build something awesome! 🌟

Happy coding! ✨👨‍💻✨
